# Objective of analysis 
Our object from analysis is to get some information about the films over than different years , as we will know the high profit film , most success film and dicrtots , most geners that made high profits ,number of films over each year,
the directors that got high idbm scores and the number of films they were made ,all these analysis help us to know the best directors and generes that made high profit 


#  Data cleaning
there were a nulls in some coulmns and extra characters that took more spaces all these things were removed and their are extra coulmn don't need it in my analysis<br /> 
no thing another we can do as data is cllaening enough to use 

# The calculated coulmn 
 here I calculated two things <br />
 first one: profit it was ( groos -budget) <br />
 as we can know the profit that each film did it will help us to detect some factors that help in this success <br />
 second: precentage of profit ((profit/budget)*100)  <br />
 
# Tools
I used only excel here with his tools
